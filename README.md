 why need object tracking ?
- Fundamnetal functionality of MOT
- ID assignmnet -
- Persistent over time
- Robust against occlusions and visually similar objects nearby

1. Model Architecture Overview:
Imagine your model as a factory that processes raw materials (input images) into final products (predictions like detecting guns, crowds, and license plates). This factory has a main assembly line (the backbone) where all the raw materials go through the same initial processing steps. After this main assembly line, the products are sent to different specialized departments (the heads) where the final touches are made based on what kind of product it is (whether it’s for gun detection, crowd detection, or license plate detection).

2. Backbone - The Shared Feature Extractor:
What It Does: The backbone is like the main conveyor belt in a factory. Every input image, regardless of whether it’s for detecting guns, crowds, or license plates, goes through this main conveyor belt.
How It Works: This backbone is a deep neural network that processes the image to extract general features. For example, it might detect edges, shapes, textures, etc., without yet knowing what those features represent.

3. Multiple Heads - Specialized Prediction Layers:
What They Do: After the backbone has processed the image, the features extracted are sent to different specialized departments (heads) in the factory. Each head is designed to produce a specific kind of product:

Gun Detection Head: This part of the model is specifically trained to look for guns in the image. It takes the features provided by the backbone and uses them to detect guns.
Crowd Detection Head: Another part of the model is focused on detecting crowds. It uses the same features from the backbone but applies different logic to find groups of people.
License Plate Detection Head: This head specializes in identifying and locating license plates in the image.
Visualization:

Imagine the backbone as a road that splits into three branches. Each branch leads to a different destination:
The first branch (head) leads to a place where guns are detected.
The second branch (head) leads to a place where crowds are detected.
The third branch (head) leads to a place where license plates are detected.

4. Training the Model:
Unified Training Process: During training, the same backbone is used to process all images, but the output from the backbone is sent to the appropriate head based on the image label.
For example, if an image contains a gun, the gun detection head will be activated and trained on that image.
If the image has a crowd, the crowd detection head will learn from that image.
If an image has a license plate, the license plate detection head will be trained.
Combined Dataset: You combine all your images (guns, crowds, license plates) into a single dataset. During training, the model learns to route the extracted features from the backbone to the correct head, depending on what needs to be detected.

5. Inference - Making Predictions:
Processing a New Image: When a new image is fed into the model, it first passes through the backbone, where general features are extracted.
Using All Heads: The model then sends these features to all the heads:
The gun detection head checks if there’s a gun.
The crowd detection head checks if there’s a crowd.
The license plate detection head looks for license plates.
Aggregating Results: The outputs from all heads are combined into a final set of predictions.

6. Deploying the Model:
Single Model File: After training, you save this entire model (backbone + all heads) into a single .pth file. This file can be loaded onto your edge device (like a camera system).
Unified Deployment: During deployment, the camera captures a frame and sends it to the model. The frame is processed by the backbone and all three heads, and the model outputs predictions for guns, crowds, and license plates all at once.
Visual Example:
Imagine you have a picture:

Step 1: The backbone looks at this picture and extracts features like shapes, edges, and textures.
Step 2: These features are then sent to three different "departments" (heads):
Head 1 (Gun Detection): Looks specifically for guns using the features.
Head 2 (Crowd Detection): Looks for groups of people (crowds).
Head 3 (License Plate Detection): Scans for license plates.
Each head then outputs its findings. The final result is a set of bounding boxes and labels for guns, crowds, and license plates, all from the same picture, processed by the same backbone but specialized by different heads.

Summary
Backbone: Shared by all tasks; extracts general features from images.
Heads: Task-specific; each head specializes in detecting a particular type of object (gun, crowd, license plate).
Training: Combine datasets and train the model so that the backbone learns to extract relevant features and each head learns to make specific predictions.
Deployment: The model is deployed as a single unit, and when an image is processed, all heads contribute to the final set of detections.
